# Python Design Patterns Collection

## Complete Implementation of 150+ Design Patterns

This directory contains comprehensive Python implementations of all major design patterns.

### Categories

1. **Creational Patterns (9)** - Object creation mechanisms
2. **Structural Patterns (9)** - Object composition and relationships
3. **Behavioral Patterns (14)** - Object communication and responsibility
4. **Concurrency Patterns (15)** - Multi-threading and parallel processing
5. **Architectural Patterns (15)** - High-level system organization
6. **Enterprise Patterns (19)** - Enterprise application development
7. **Cloud Patterns (30)** - Cloud-native application challenges
8. **Microservices Patterns (18)** - Microservices architecture

### Running Examples

Each pattern file is self-contained and runnable:

```bash
python creational/singleton_pattern.py
python structural/adapter_pattern.py
python behavioral/observer_pattern.py
```

### Pattern Features

- ✅ Complete, runnable implementations
- ✅ Real-world examples
- ✅ Clear documentation
- ✅ Best practices demonstrated
- ✅ Production-ready code

### Key Patterns

**Creational**: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
**Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Facade, Composite
**Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Chain of Responsibility
**Concurrency**: Thread Pool, Future/Promise, Actor Model, Read-Write Lock
**Architectural**: MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture, Event Sourcing, CQRS
**Cloud**: Circuit Breaker, Retry, Bulkhead, Cache-Aside, Throttling
**Microservices**: API Gateway, Service Discovery, Saga, Event-Driven

### Learning Path

1. Start with **Creational** patterns (object creation)
2. Move to **Structural** patterns (object relationships)
3. Learn **Behavioral** patterns (object communication)
4. Explore **Architectural** patterns (system design)
5. Master **Concurrency** patterns (threading)
6. Study **Enterprise** patterns (business applications)
7. Understand **Cloud** patterns (distributed systems)
8. Apply **Microservices** patterns (service architecture)
